# Clima

Created an API-based mobile application that delivers real-time weather information for any city, including actionable suggestions tailored to current weather conditions. 
Leveraged Flutter for a seamless cross-platform user interface, Firebase for backend services such as user authentication and data storage, and the OpenWeather API for accurate and up-to-date weather data. The app enhances user experience by providing personalized recommendations based on weather forecasts, such as suggesting appropriate attire or activities.
